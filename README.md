# How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the PhysicalAccessControl_v_0_1_8_7.ino file in the Arduino IDE.
Install the required libraries by going to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries.
Connect the hardware components according to the wiring diagram provided in the PhysicalAccessControl.png file.
Upload the code to the ESP32 microcontroller.
Power on the microcontroller and connect to the WiFi network.
Access the web interface by going to the IP address of the microcontroller in a web browser.
Use the web interface to manage access codes and settings.
Use the keypad to enter access codes and grant access to the space.
